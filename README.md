Frontend Task

My Thought Process:
I wanted to make "Without Simbian" look stressful with all those alerts piling up, and "With Simbian" look clean and organized. The animations tell this story - alerts keep coming in on one side while the other shows a smooth, orderly process.

Animation Library:
I used Framer Motion because it's easy to work with in React. The animation "variants" helped me create the step-by-step animations and the cool transitions between states. For some of the fancier stuff like the moving dots between process steps, I combined Framer Motion with regular CSS animations.

Future Improvements:
1. Improve mobile responsiveness for the horizontal process flow
2. Add more interaction between elements (e.g., hovering on a step highlights related summary cards)
3. Optimize performance, especially when many alerts are being generated
4. If I had high quality assets, i'd have used them as well to make it better in terms of appearance
5. Organise the code in a better way.
